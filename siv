20130528 - began removing unneeded local accounts as part of the standard build, added some subnet logic functions to common_functions.h
20130610 - changed the f_IsNetUp function to use both ping and arping to check the gateway for connectivity.

Added a -ua switch to configure_ldap.sh to prevent prompting the user. Updated the DNS servers checked by the AtWest function. Updated the default DNS servers in all current kickstart scripts.
20130619 - changed configure_newlinux.sh logic to remove unneeded Intercall local account logic. Intercall will have the same static DNS config, but non-intercall servers will all be configured with configure_dns.sh, which will automatically determine the closest site-specific DNS servers and primary servers based on the contents of /maint/scripts/dnsservers.txt.

20130730 - complete re-write of configure_syslog.sh to increase consistency with legacy processes. A "debug" mode was added to turn off external logging during build and development, custom log rotation scripting controls the west legacy log files. Legacy files are rotated at midnight rather than by cron.daily.
20130805 - removed automatic SNMP configuration from the build process per Spectrum team.
20130821 - added a line to the internal IPTables configuration to address NFS issues
20130913 - Updated configure_ldap.sh and configure_dmzldap.sh to set "idle_timelimit" to 300 seconds to prevent runaway processes from overloading the LDAP servers with open connections.  Turned off Red Hat license service by default.

20130924 - Changed configure_ldap.sh and configure_dmzldap.sh to skip firewalled LDAP servers faster.  Changed configure_syslog.sh to fix a bug when encountering unexpected fields in the "expcfg" file.
20131009 - Added InfoSec SIEM logging details to default logging configuration.
20131018 - Changed configure_ldap.sh to require admin login to add a machine netgroup, and the IP and adding user name to the machine netgroup's description. Added verbiage about the new fields to configure_dmzldap.sh.
20131022 - Fixed a bug in configure_syslog.sh that would cause compression overrides in configure_syslog.conf to be ignored if the target file was set not to use fsync (prefixed with a - in the [r]syslog.conf)
20131022a - Changed the wording in the configure_dmzldap.sh script to "Hostname" instead of "Netgroup Name" so it was more aligned with the process of using ng_create.sh
20131023 - Added xswn01dz01 to ldapservers.txt and configure_dmzldap.sh
20131029 - Added xlon13dz01 and xlon13dz02 to ldapservers.txt and configure_dmzldap.sh

20150508 - (dglinder) Rewrite of the unattended mode check code to add ability to choose method to run from command line while supporting existing script calls.
20150511 - (dglinder) Remove the initial regen_hypericagent.sh script to avoid confusion.
20150511 - (adm) updated setup_ldap.sh to use commas for the URI listing, instead of spaces.
20150511 - (adm) updated bb hosts parameters per SDR 6538281 - requested by Shefl, approved by Moeller.
20150511 - (adm) updated all images to include a 6gb partition for openv (netbackup agent).
20150513 - (dgl) Modified vmware tools package to recompile on reboot.  This will stop vmtools from breaking after OS patches update kernels and kernel headers.
20150513 - (adm) Removed gnome desktop meta package from ks5_u11 build image.  
20150513 - (adm) Removed "System Tools" from ks5_u11 to stop installing samba - added other packages manually to compensate.

20150513 - (adm) Removed a line from setup_hostname.sh that was rewriting "127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain" to read "127.0.0.1 linux####" this was causing sendmail to hang on startup because localhost was not defined.
20150513 - (adm) Removed lines from setup_services.sh that were removing sendmail from startup, and re-adding it, effectively turning it on by default, which is something the script was turning off in the step before.  Scripted notes say this should not be on by default.

20150526 - (dglinder) Remove the long sleep and poweroff, moved to cloud clone prep script.
20150526 - (dglinder) Give user 30 seconds to react, then power off system.  This is necessary because the VMware tools are stopped and we are unable to perform a clean shutdown if necessary.
20150526 - (dglinder) Add common functions code for use in script.
20150527 - (dglinder) Fix the code that was blanking out the /etc/issue and /etc/issue.net files.

20151007 - (amayberr) Adding sssd package to kickstart for rhel6.7.
20151007 - (amayberr) Updating setup_linux.sh to change step 800 from "setup_ldap.sh" to "setup_auth.sh" this will cleanly allow me to call either setup_ldap.sh or setup_ldap-sssd.sh depending on the chosen option.
20151007 - (amayberr) Creating setup_auth.sh script, which will prompt the user for an authentication service, and call the appropriate setup script.
20151007 - (amayberr) Updated Motd script site location example help text from "OMA01" to "DEN06".
20151007 - (amayberr) Updated sitelist.cfg to note sites scheduled for evacuation.
20151013 - (amayberr) Removed the sssd packages from the kickstart profile.  SSSD packages interfere with legacy NSS.  Moved SSSD packages to the setup_ldap-sssd.sh script as a blind yum install, no pre-checks.  It's either there, or it will be, or it can't be because satellite registration failed.
20151013 - (amayberr) added satellite registration to the kickstart process.  All builds will now be registered by default.
20151013 - (amayberr) modified setup_rhss.sh to parse /etc/sso to determine appropriate BU and translate to the proper registration key.  Supplying a BU at the command line as an argument overrides this behavior. WAN and WBS are merged in to WIC, any unrecognized entry will pass through as the BU identifier to the next step in the process, in case something changes later.
20151111 - (amayberr) Added setup_rhss-autopatch.sh to the build process, automating patching. Old setup_rhss.sh doesn't patch by default, for use when systems need registration only.
20151111 - (amayberr) /boot partition increased from 150mb to 1.5gb on 6_u7 and 5_u11 builds.
20151111 - (amayberr) setup_files scripts updated to change default permissions on /maint and /maint/scripts from 777 to 755.
20151111 - (amayberr) added legacy DMZ subnets to common_functions.h. These shouldn't be used going forward.  216.57.96.0/20 199.38.32.0/20 199.38.48.0/22 155.254.144.0/20 63.234.247.48/29
<<<<<<< .mine
20151217 - (amayberr) Infosec requires single user mode to require a root password.  Updated setup_ldap script accordingly.
=======
20151208 - (dglinder) Add the TESTING flag to ease the validation of new verions of binaries and configuration files.
>>>>>>> .r146
20160415 - (amayberr) updated setup_ldap.sh to use '|sort |uniq -w 8 | sort -t , -k2 -n | head -5' instead of '| sort -t , -k2 -n | head -5' --  The practical impact will be 5 servers in nslcd.conf instead of 3, and only the fastest server from each site will be used.  I.E. a server in longmont will only get the fastest den06 server, not all 3 den06 servers.  Also, anything older than RHEL5 is now administratively prevented from being configured with this script.  TLS restriction in 2017 will prevent RHEL5 and older from being connected to our directory services, so there is no point in allowing RHEL4/RHEL3 to be configured (we've never had anyone use it there anyway)
